October: 
    Settling on the specifics of the architecture. Decided on going with a program that takes in audio wave files and
    makes visuals from that rather than going from strudel code directly to support more audio inputs. RPi5 has been
    approved and ordered to use as computer and controller for the light system. 

    TODO
        take measurements of lecture pit and determine lighting hardware needed
        do a web audio lab, get some practice sending and recieving audio signals over an internet connection
        think about what the art should look like (color schemes, shapes, composition, lines, etc.)

November:
    Did updated background lit review and made new github repo for new project. Started on hardware, got RPi5
    up and running as well as the arduino uno with some little LED sketches
